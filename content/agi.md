This repository is a collection of resources about artificial general intelligence for personal research. 

**Artificial general intelligence (AGI)** is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can. Current AI research is primarily focusing on weak AI and is limited to the use of software to study or accomplish specific problem solving or reasoning tasks. 
The papers listed in this repository are not strictly examples of AGI according to the deifnition, but I see it as a prelude to the real AGI as they are capable of **performing many diverse tasks without specific training** and considered by some to be too advanced to classify as a narrow AI system.

To be specific, this repo contains papers in the following directions:

- Broaden the application of existing weak artificial intelligence, so that machine vision, language understanding, etc. can be applied to more scenarios in life.
- Expand the horizons of computer scientists, pay more attention to the development and application of psychology, neuroscience, and brain science, and obtain inspiration from human-related fields and sources of artificial intelligence development.
- Predefine and solve the social and philosophical problems that general artificial intelligence may bring.
